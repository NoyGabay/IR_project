Information Retrieval Final Project.
In our final project in information retrieval we build a search engine for English Wikipedia.

Description of the above file: 
1. serarch_frontend: python file which contains all search functions our serach engine performs. Full documentation of each function can be found in the file.
2. search_backrnd: python file which contains all background logic and functionality that helped us implement all search functions.
